
Here is my outline of the README file which I wll translate in to  the correct format later

# Title VBA of Wall Street Unit 2 Challenge Project

## Purpose

Given a spreadsheet containing stock data, use pivot tables to summarize data and visualize trends using graphs.

Solve the problem for a single stock, then generalize the code to be able to handle multiple stocks using nested for loops. 

Finally, optimize (refactor) the VBA code to run more efficiently by using a single loop and storing data in arrays.

Demonstrate the the code ran in less time after the modifications.

Include a screen capture that shows the code is commented clearly.

Extra Credit - in Module 1, I wrote a subroutine "Sub BuildTickerColumn(year$)" which returns the list of ticker values for a specific year based on the data in the spreadsheet rather than hard coding the values.

Include the following paragraphs

# Overview of Project

# Results of the ANalysis (including screen shots and code snippets)

# Summary
## Explain the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
## Explain the pros/cons of the original VBA script vs the refactored script
